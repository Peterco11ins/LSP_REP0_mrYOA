# AI Prompts and Assistance for Assignment 3

This document records the key prompts and AI assistance used during the object-oriented redesign of the ETL pipeline.

## Initial Analysis Prompt

**Prompt**: "I need to redesign my Assignment 2 ETL pipeline to be more object-oriented. Can you analyze my current code and suggest improvements for better OO design?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Looking at your Assignment 2 code, I can see several opportunities for better object-oriented decomposition. Your current `ETLProcessor` class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling data extraction, transformation, and loading all in one class. I suggest breaking this into specialized classes: `DataReader`, `DataWriter`, `ProductTransformer`, and `ETLOrchestrator`."

**How Used**: This analysis helped identify the main design issues and provided a clear direction for the redesign.

## Class Design Prompt

**Prompt**: "How should I design the Product class to have better encapsulation while maintaining the same functionality?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "For better encapsulation, consider adding an `updatePrice()` method that automatically recalculates the price range when the price changes. This ensures data consistency and encapsulates the business rule that price and price range are related. Also, make the price range calculation private since it's an internal implementation detail."

**How Used**: Implemented the `updatePrice()` method and improved the encapsulation of the Product class.

## Transformation Logic Prompt

**Prompt**: "How can I better organize the transformation logic to follow OO principles?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Create a dedicated `ProductTransformer` class that encapsulates all transformation rules. Use constants for magic numbers like discount rates and thresholds. Break down the transformation into smaller, focused methods like `isElectronicsProduct()` and `applyElectronicsTransformations()`. This makes the code more readable and the business rules more explicit."

**How Used**: Created the `ProductTransformer` class with well-organized methods and constants for business rules.

## Error Handling Prompt

**Prompt**: "How should I handle errors in the new object-oriented design while maintaining the same error handling behavior as Assignment 2?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Maintain the same error handling strategy but distribute it appropriately across classes. Each class should handle errors relevant to its responsibility. The `DataReader` should handle file reading errors, `DataWriter` should handle file writing errors, and the `ETLOrchestrator` should catch and report errors from all components. Use the same exception types to maintain compatibility."

**How Used**: Implemented consistent error handling across all classes while maintaining the same error behavior as Assignment 2.

## Documentation Prompt

**Prompt**: "Can you help me write comprehensive Javadoc comments for all the classes and methods in the redesigned ETL pipeline?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "For Javadoc comments, include: class-level documentation explaining the class purpose and responsibility, method documentation with @param and @return tags, @author and @version tags, and @since tags for version tracking. Focus on explaining the 'why' not just the 'what' - explain the business purpose and design decisions."

**How Used**: Generated comprehensive Javadoc comments for all classes and public methods, focusing on business context and design rationale.

## Testing Strategy Prompt

**Prompt**: "How can I verify that my redesigned code produces exactly the same output as the original Assignment 2?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Test systematically: 1) Compile both versions, 2) Run both with the same input data, 3) Compare the output files byte-for-byte, 4) Test edge cases like empty files and malformed data, 5) Verify error handling behavior is identical. The key is to ensure functional equivalence while improving the internal design."

**How Used**: Followed this systematic testing approach to verify that Assignment 3 produces identical output to Assignment 2.

## Reflection Writing Prompt

**Prompt**: "Help me write a comprehensive reflection comparing Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 implementations. What specific aspects should I focus on?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Focus on: 1) Specific design differences with code examples, 2) How each OO concept (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) was applied, 3) Concrete benefits like maintainability and testability, 4) Testing verification with actual results, 5) Specific examples of how the code is more professional and follows best practices."

**How Used**: Used this guidance to structure the reflection document with specific examples and concrete comparisons.

## Key AI Assistance Summary

1. **Design Analysis**: Identified monolithic design issues and suggested decomposition strategy
2. **Class Design**: Provided specific recommendations for better encapsulation and organization
3. **Code Organization**: Suggested method breakdown and constant usage for better maintainability
4. **Error Handling**: Advised on maintaining compatibility while improving error distribution
5. **Documentation**: Helped create comprehensive Javadoc comments
6. **Testing**: Provided systematic approach for verifying functional equivalence
7. **Reflection**: Guided the structure and content of the comparison document

## Adaptation and Customization

While the AI provided excellent guidance, several adaptations were made:
- Customized the class names to be more descriptive
- Added additional helper methods for better code organization
- Enhanced the Product class with more sophisticated encapsulation
- Created more detailed Javadoc comments with business context
- Structured the reflection to focus on specific OO concepts and concrete examples

The AI assistance was invaluable for identifying design improvements and providing best practices, but the final implementation reflects careful consideration of the specific requirements and custom adaptations for the assignment context.
